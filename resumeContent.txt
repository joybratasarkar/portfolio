AI Interview Platform (Flagship Project) - Leading 4-Engineer Team
•	Challenge: Build AI system that conducts natural, human-like interviews autonomously
•	Solution & Impact: Led 4-engineer team to engineer breakthrough conversational AI platform with real-time processing:
∗ Collaborated with stakeholders to determine user requirements and translate business needs into technical specifications
∗ Contributed to system design documents and identified cross-module dependencies for scalable architecture
∗ Real-time speech processing pipeline achieving sub-50ms response latency with Silero VAD, model optimization, and WebSocket streaming, implementing smart turn detection to distinguish between natural speech pauses and completed thoughts, preventing AI interruptions while eliminating response delays
∗ Implemented smart turn detection using open-source Pipe-cat adapted for real-time AI interview agent for conversation endpoint prediction with sub-50ms inference
∗ Implemented intelligent conversation orchestration via LangGraph state machine with Vertex AI Gemini 2.0
∗ Integrated dynamic question generation, real-time scoring (0-10 scale), and adaptive followup logic
∗ Architected distributed system supporting 100+ concurrent connections with < 50ms WebSocket routing, multi-layer Redis architecture (broker + state + pub/sub), 0.1s polling intervals, and pattern-based resource cleanup with distributed locking
∗ Optimized tensor reuse and memory management achieving <100ms audio processing and 200MB per worker efficiency
